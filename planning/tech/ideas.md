An electric crossbow made of steel, that uses magnetic force to help pull the string. (T2)

A wireless storage connector that connects to a void driver to transport between locations. 
Also has a remote for accessing from multiple different stations, but there is a buffer time depending on the distance. 
(Calculated from distance to 0, 0, as that is where the wormhole is assumed to be.)
The remote also requires a station to access items, but this can be negated by having a portable void driver that can 
access items, albeit at a much slower rate. (T3-5)

Reactive armor, using far more advanced technology than IRL military-grade reactive armor, such as dynamic reflectivity to refract lasers, 
hardening to prevent normal damage, and integration with biological organisms to be able to protect it far better than fully separated armor ever could. (T5)
