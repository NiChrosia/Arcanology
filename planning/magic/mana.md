# Mana

An explanation of how the system for mana functions, including obtainment, usage, and elemental energy, cores, and countermeasures.

## Obtainment

Mana is obtained from the energy simply in the air. The quantity and quality of elemental energy is drastically increased 
when near an elemental hotspot or a hotspot of mana itself. Such hotspots include:

- 0, 0 (Void, The End)
- Blackstone Delta (Fire, Nether)
- Deep Ocean (Water, Overworld)
- Extreme Hills (Earth, Overworld)
- Strongholds (Mana, Overworld)

## Usage

Elemental energy is by itself useless, and can only be used when combined with mana. The way this process works is by using mana generated internally in 
combination with elemental energy, to mix it and create spells. Mana is used similarly to electricity, but with far more power, allowing for extremely
complicated devices, such as a void driver, pocket repository, and military-grade technology such as gravitational railguns, radiopulse emitters, etc.

## Elemental energy

Elemental energy is an aspect of mana, and is embodied by its respective symbol. More information about the abilities of 
each branch can be found in the [branches](/planning/magic/branches.md).

## Cores

A core is a small organic crystal capable of manipulating mana. Synthetic forms also exist, capable of extremely high precision, speed, and power, resulting in
being far superior to an organic copy when handled by appropriate machinery. Training an organic core is significantly more difficult, but allows for greater control
in case of an unlikely malfunction. Creation of synthetic cores is done by coalescing magical energy into a suitable form, with quality depending on the metal/crystal
used, as well as the quality of the mana used in the infusion. An example of the materials used in a high-qualtiy artificial core would be a xenothite base, and an
arcane infuser positioned nearby a stronghold, to take advantage of the rich natural mana.

## Countermeasures

Mana can be nullified using a MNF (mana nullification field) created from towers that absorb the natural mana in the air and disperse it elsewhere, to effectively
disable magic in the immediate area.
