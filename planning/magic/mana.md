# Mana

An explanation of how the system for mana functions, including obtainment, usage, and elemental energy.

## Obtainment

Mana is obtained from the energy simply in the air. The quantity and quality of elemental energy is drastically increased 
when near an elemental hotspot or a hotspot of mana itself. Such hotspots include:

- 0, 0 (Void, The End)
- Blackstone Delta (Fire, Nether)
- Deep Ocean (Water, Overworld)
- Extreme Hills (Earth, Overworld)
- Strongholds (Mana, Overworld)

## Usage

Elemental energies by itself cannot do much, as each element has specific power, for example; earth is hard, and capable 
of assuming hard walls, while fire is more shapeless and is primarily used as an offense, utilizing its high temperatures.
When combined into a whole, however, it can assume all the abilities of the elements, and utilize them to their maximum.
Mana is typically used similarly to electricity, to provide light, shelter, transportation, and more.

## Elemental energy

Elemental energy is an aspect of mana, and is embodied by its respective symbol. More information about the abilities of 
each branch can be found in the (branches)[/planning/magic/branches.md].
