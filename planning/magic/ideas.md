A rune infuser, which takes an empty rune (Made of calcite/diamond/xenothite), and applies a pattern to it using elemental crystals.
Rune patterns are unlocked by finding them randomly in chests, or by artificially experimenting, which will give a random 
(weighted, more likely to give a more common type, and can still give you ones you already have.) (T3-5)

A magical device which uses the mana element as a substitute for food, resulting in effective saturation as long as the device has mana. (T4)

Elemental hearts that empower the surrounding area, even to the degree of enchanting ores (T5)

Adaptive armor, reacts to things such as water with artificial gills, absorbing electric shocks, and developing an artificial parachute in milliseconds.
It would also be capable of absorbing energy of the nearby terrain, and storing that energy to protect against the opposite force in the future, 
as well as using it for other properties. (T5)
