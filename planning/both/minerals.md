## Tech

- "Accumulite." A unique metal that rather than conducting electricity, it simply absorbs it, seemingly to an nigh-infinite capacity. Naturally found extremely deep within any sort of large celestial body, as it seems to be formed primarily by gravity, as well as titanium for a base. It is almost always used in batteries.

- "Zytrinium." An extremely dense metal found at the very cores of planets, created from extreme nuclear fusion. Its special properties are the sheer impact and tensile strength as well as ultra-high temperature resistance, resulting in the ability to protect from nearly any type of impact or pulling apart. It also stays in liquid form the majority of the time, but similarly to glass, it acts solid at the macro level. Extracting this metal from the core is a seemingly impossible task, due to the sheer gravitational force upon it, but it rarely moves upwards from the core by magma streams, resulting in very rare veins of it. It is primarily used in armor plating, blunt weapons, and high-heat weaponry. The sheer strength of it is due to the unique atomic structure, which is comprised of tetrahedrons all completely linked, resulting in shattering being nigh impossible, as well as extreme resistance to compression, impacts, and other types of stress.

- "Xytryllitite." A rare crystal that seems to absorb most properties around it, such as heat, light, and vitality from living creatures. It can also absorb cold temperatures, and manipulate the speed of its own molecular components accordingly. It is typically used in "temperature batteries", to help with superconductors, flashlights, or as a """first-aid kit""" for healing a organic being, however, it can only provide sustenance by providing energy or regenerating blood, but cannot help with large damage such as losing limbs. It is rarely found in areas that receive concentrated amounts of the aforementioned properties, such as byproducts of nuclear reactions, the light side of tidally locked planets, and in the core of a strange object known as a "nether star."

- "Gravityte." A strange crystal capable of resizing at will, without damaging the integrity of the structure contained within. It is created from inducing a heavy gravitational pull on a xytrylite crystal, and then activating it with the void, using an arcane focuser.

## Magic

### Light

- "Prismynitite." A rare luminescent crystal capable of emitting high information density bursts of light, that are abnormally stable. It is created from infusing xrytrylite to the maximum possible capacity with light, and activating it with a energy catalyst, such as a nether star. (The energy catalyst can be re-used infinitely.) It is primarily used in information technology, such as the data part of the void driver, and other extremely-high speed data transfer requirement applications.

### Void

- "Velosium." A good conductor of arcane energies, typically used as a replacement for silver when the situation requires it, or when optimal speed is wanted. It also has an arcane linkage with the void element, due to being naturally purified by its energies there. It is found deep within the end islands, more so nearby voidic hearts. It can also store a small cache of energy, which amounts to a very large amount when atomically condensed.

- "Xenothite." A "magical superconductor", that is magically bonded with the void element, allowing it to exceed the normal limits of space. It can transmit energy from one point to another, with the speed depending on the size of the payload, as well as the distance. It is formed from an alloy of zytrinium and velosium, which is then put into an arcane focuser situated in "the End", which will slowly infuse it with voidic energies, until it eventually crystalizes into its final form. It is used for extremely high-tier weaponry and armor, as it is very expensive & difficult to produce.
