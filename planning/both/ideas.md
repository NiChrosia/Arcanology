Cross-dimensional transport system using concentrated void element to destabilize space and create a wormhole. Also called a void driver. (T3-5)

A shield comprised of warped spacetime created from antimatter and void element, that makes normal attacks utterly redundant. (T4)

A special new type of tool comprised mainly of arcane energy, with small amounts of material for controlling it. (T4-5)

Runes, to be installed on specific tools, that allows for specializations, as well as general-purpose upgrades. (T1-5)

A handheld railgun capable of firing projectiles at over 500 m/s, using pure silver ammunition, and using large amounts 
of electricity (1K EF per tick,) as well as powerful bursts of air from the sky element. (T5)

Variable armor, a special type of armor which uses both the power of magic and technology, which fluctuates in power 
depending on the location, as well as storing elemental energy from the current location for usage later.
It also has powerful utilities built into it, such as a large storage area built in a fraction of the area normally 
required using the void element. It also heavily uses technologies similar to the adaptive armor, and will allow for 
full adaptation into the environment. (T6)
