# Ideas

- Cross-dimensional transport system using concentrated void element to destabilize space and create a wormhole. Also called a void driver. (T3-5)

- A shield comprised of warped spacetime created from antimatter and void element, that makes normal attacks utterly redundant. (T4)

- A special new type of tool comprised mainly of arcane energy, with small amounts of material for controlling it. (T4-5)

- Runes, to be installed on specific tools, that allows for specializations, as well as general-purpose upgrades. (T1-5)

- A handheld railgun utilizing void magic to gravitationally acceleration projectiles to FTL speeds. Mana consumption scales linearly with speed. (T5)

- A rapid-fire weapon capable of emitting concentrated pulses of radioactivity. The pulses inflict the withered effect, with level depending on the amount of
radioactivity, which is produced from earth magic. The amount scales linearly with the mana consumption, up until wither 3, in which the consumption exponentially 
increases. (T5)

- A dimensional space capable of holding many items. The maximum quantity it can hold is dependent on the size of the dimensional fissure, which can be increased by 
using void and earth magic to gravitationally force it open, and earth barriers to keep it stable. The actual raw max quantity of the repository is an integer, and 
each type of item can be stored infinitely. However, magic is constantly required to keep it stable, and the magic cost exponentially increases with the size.
Named "pocket repository." (T5)

- Variable armor, a special type of armor which uses both the power of magic and technology, which fluctuates in power depending on the location, as well as storing elemental energy from the current location for usage later via xytrylite. It also has powerful utilities built into it, such as a large storage area built in a fraction of the area normally required using the void element. It also heavily uses technologies similar to the adaptive armor, and will allow for full adaptation into the environment. It requires usage of prismynitite for data transfer due to the sheer quantity, as well as xenothite emitter integration with the battery to rapidly provide each part of the armor with the extreme amount of power required. The battery is also comprised mainly of accumulite, while the raw armor plating is primarily made of zytrinium.
