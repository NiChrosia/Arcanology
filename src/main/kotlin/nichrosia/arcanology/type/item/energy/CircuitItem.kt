/** The base class for all circuits. Each are comprised of an energy source, a conductor, a switch, and the load.
 *
 * The quality and efficiency of each circuit depends on the material is it made of.
 * For example, a silver wire is far more effective than a copper or aluminum one.
 *
 * Circuits:
 *
 * Rudimentary Circuit: A simple but bulky circuit crafted by hand from aluminum wiring and alkaline batteries.
 *
 * Basic Circuit: A simple machine made circuit comprised of copper wiring and nickel-zinc batteries.
 *
 * Advanced Circuit: A more advanced machine-crafted circuit made up of gold wires and a lithium-sulfur battery.
 *
 * Supercircuit: An incredibly powerful circuit meticulously crafted by machinery, made up of pure silver wiring and
 * solid state batteries. */
